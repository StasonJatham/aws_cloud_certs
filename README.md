## AWS Cloud Practitioner

### AWS Overview
(AWS) Cloud is
- more efficient
- scalable 
- reduced risks because agile , can adapt to change
this reduces risk 

scalable
- use services at own pace
- scalabiullity = use resources needed (more or less) 
- cloud can adapt to needs

- high availabillty
- increase speed

agile
- use aws datacenters to get close to customers
- global reach 
- focus less on infrastrucutre

experiment with low cost an low risk
leads to more innovation

elasticity
-scale resources up or down quickly
- add resources needed
- shut down resources no longer needed

low latency and better experience fgor your customer

reliabillty
get computing resources as needed
get more capacity that oon-prem does not have

AWS regions
- seperate geograp√ºhic region 
- isolated in many availabillty zones

places reesources in multiple different location 
using more availabillty zones gets more fault tolerance

fault tolerance = system remains operational even though some parts of it fail 
downtime is minimized without human intervention

You own your own data, amazon doies not have access to your data, you hold the encryption keys 

AWS monitoring contoinually 

AWS industry leading capabillities , so services meet stricted security requirements

AWS datacenters are protected by security guardss and access is strictly regulated 

aws assets can use your own security policies freom the get go 



### AWS Management Interfaces

convenient options of using resources
- AWS Management Console
graphical interface to access feature
easy search for what you need
browse through all servioces
you can pin icons right to the toolbar
resource groups to streamline aws console
quickly navigate to each resource group

Resource Groups are identiy specifc so each user can create their own 
youz can share resource group defintions with users in same account 

learn to build has learning resources like tutorials and guides docs so you can learn to build what you need




- command line interface
lets u control aws from command line
used to automate and repeat tasks
all operating systems are supportewd



- Softwarew Development Kits (SDK)
control api through programming languages 
help u use aws in existing applications



all built upon aws api = foundation 
can use all of the above ways interchangibly 


power to scale computignn resources up and down quickly = elasticity 


Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
